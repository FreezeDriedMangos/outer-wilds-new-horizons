# Outer Wilds New Horizons
        
This is the official documentation for [New Horizons](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-new-horizons){ target="_blank" }

## Getting Started

Before starting, go into your in-game mod settings for New Horizons and switch Debug mode on. This allows you to:

- Use the Prop Placer tool. This convienence tool allows you to place details in game and save your work to your config files.
- Print the position of what you are looking at to the logs by pressing "P". This is useful for determining locations to place props the Prop Placer is unable to, such as signal scope points or dialogue triggers.
- Use the "Reload Configs" button in the pause menu. This will restart the current solar system and update all the planets. Much faster than quitting and relaunching the game.

!!! alert-danger "Get VSCode"
    Please get [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/){ target="_blank" } or some other advanced text editor, as it will help highlight common errors.

Planets are created using a JSON file format structure, and placed in a folder called planets (or in any subdirectory of it) in the location where New Horizons is installed (by default this folder doesn't exist, you have to create it within the xen.NewHorizons directory). You can learn how the configs work by picking apart the [Real Solar System](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-real-solar-system){ target="_blank" } mod or the [New Horizons Examples](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-new-horizons-examples){ target="_blank" } mod.

To locate this directory, click the "â‹®" symbol next to "New Horizons" in the Outer Wilds Mod Manager and then click "
show in explorer" in the pop-up.

![Create a new folder named "planets"]({{ "images/home/create_planets.webp"|static }})

Planets can also be placed in a folder called planets within a separate mod, if you plan on releasing your planets on the mod database. The [Config Template](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-new-horizons-config-template){ target="_blank" } is available if you want to release your own planet mod using configs.

Now that you have created your planets folder, this is where you will put your planet config files. A config file will
look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Wetrock",
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-new-horizons/main/NewHorizons/Schemas/body_schema.json",
  "starSystem": "SolarSystem",
  "Base": {
    "groundSize": 100,
    "surfaceSize": 101,
    "surfaceGravity": 12,
    "hasMapMarker": true
  },
  "Orbit": {
    "semiMajorAxis": 1300,
    "inclination": 0,
    "primaryBody": "TIMBER_HEARTH",
    "isMoon": true,
    "isTidallyLocked": true,
    "longitudeOfAscendingNode": 0,
    "eccentricity": 0,
    "argumentOfPeriapsis": 0
  },
  "Atmosphere": {
    "size": 150,
    "fogTint": {
      "r": 200,
      "g": 255,
      "b": 255,
      "a": 255
    },
    "fogSize": 150,
    "fogDensity": 0.2,
    "hasRain": true
  },
  "Props": {
    "scatter": [
      {
        "path": "DreamWorld_Body/Sector_DreamWorld/Sector_DreamZone_1/Props_DreamZone_1/OtherComponentsGroup/Trees_Z1/DreamHouseIsland/Tree_DW_M_Var",
        "count": 12
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The first field you should have in any config file is the `name`. This should be unique in the solar system. If it
isn't, the mod will instead try to modify the planet that already has that name.

After `name` is `starSystem`. You can use this to place the planet in a different system accessible using a black-hole or via the ship's warp drive (accessible from the ship log computer). To ensure compatibility with other mods this name should be unique. After setting a value for this, the changes in the config will only affect that body in that star system. By default, it is "SolarSystem", which is the scene from the stock game.

Including the "$schema" line is optional, but will allow your text editor to highlight errors and auto-suggest words in your config. I recommend using VSCode as a text editor, but anything that supports Json files will work. Something as basic as notepad will work but will not highlight any of your errors.

The config file is then split into modules, each one with its own fields that define how that part of the planet will be generated. In the example above I've used the `Base`, `Orbit`, `Atmosphere`, and `Props` modules. A config file must have a `Base` and `Orbit` module, the rest are optional.

Each `{` must match up with a closing `}` to denote its section. If you don't know how JSONs work then check Wikipedia.

Modules look like this:

```json
{
  "Star": {
    "size": 3000,
    "tint": {
      "r": 201,
      "g": 87,
      "b": 55,
      "a": 255
    }
  }
}
```

In this example the `Star` module has a `size` field and a `tint` field. Since the colour is a complex object it needs
another set of `{` and `}` around it, and then it has its own fields inside it : `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a`. Don't forget to put
commas after each field.

Most fields are either true/false, a decimal number, and integer number, or a string (word with quotation marks around
it).

To see all the different things you can put into a config file check out the [Celestial Body schema]({{ 'Celestial Body Schema'|route}}).

### Using the Prop Placer

The Prop Placer is a tool that lets you manually place details from inside the game. Once enabled, press "G" and your currently selected prop will be placed wherever your crosshair is pointing.

How to Enable:
1. Pause the game. You will see an extra menu option titled "Toggle Prop Placer Menu". Click it
1. The prop placer menu should now be open. At the bottom of the menu, you will see a list of mods. Click yours.
  1. This menu scrolls. If you do not see your mod, it may be further down the list.
1. The Prop Placer is now active! Unpause the game and you can now place Nomai vases using "G"

What's that? You want to place something other than just vases? Well I can't say I agree with your choices, but here's how you would do that.

How to Select Props:
1. Pause the game again. The prop placer menu should still be visible.
1. At the top of the menu, you'll see a text box contianing the path for the vase. Replace this with the path for the prop you want to place. For example: `DreamWorld_Body/Sector_DreamWorld/Sector_DreamZone_1/Props_DreamZone_1/OtherComponentsGroup/Trees_Z1/DreamHouseIsland/Tree_DW_M_Var`
  1. Tip: use the Unity Explorer mod to find the path for the object you want to place. You only have to do this once.
1. Unpause the game and press "G". Say hello to your new tree!
1. Pause the game again. You will now see the prop you just placed on the list of recently placed props just below the "path" text box.
1. Click on the button titled "Prefab_NOM_VaseThin". You can now place vases again.

Extra features:
1. Made a mistake? **Press the "-" key to undo.** Press the "+" key to redo.
1. If you have the Unity Explorer mod enabled, you can use this to tweak the position, rotation, and scale of your props. Your changes will be saved.
1. Want to save some recently placed props between game launches? On the recently placed props list, click the star next to the prop's name to favorite it.

## Publishing Your Mod

Once your mod is complete, you can use the [planet creation template](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-new-horizons-config-template#readme){ target="_blank" } GitHub template.

## Helpful Resources

The texturemap/heightmap feature was inspired by the Kerbal Space Program mod Kopernicus. A lot of the same techniques that apply to
planet creation there apply to New Horizons. If you need help with planetary texturing, check out [The KSP texturing guide](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/165285-planetary-texturing-guide-repository/){ target="_blank" }.

[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/){ target="_blank" } is a free browser-based photo editor which has useful features like
rectangular-to-polar coordinate transformation, useful for fixing abnormalities at the poles of your planets. 

### Helpful Mods

These mods are useful when developing your addon

- [Unity Explorer](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/unityexplorer){ target="_blank" } - Used to find the paths of game objects for copying and can be used to manually position props, ship log entries, and more.
- [Collider Visualizer](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/collidervisualizer){ target="_blank" } - Useful when creating dialogue triggers or reveal volumes
- [Save Editor](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/saveeditor){ target="_blank" } - Useful when creating a custom [ship log]({{ "Ship Log"|route }}), can be used to reveal all custom facts so you can see them in the ship's computer
